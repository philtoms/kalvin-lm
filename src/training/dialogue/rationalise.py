"""The Rationalising Trainee — a drop-in replacement for ``TableTrainee``.

Plan: ``@plans/implement-rationalising-trainee.md``.
Spec seam: ``@specs/dialogue-driven-training.md`` §Actor, §The Runner,
§Validation (unchanged — the rationaliser satisfies the existing contract).

Unlike the table-reading ``TableTrainee`` (which yields the table's K-rows in
order), the Rationaliser **rationalises**: it maintains a minimal model of what
it has grounded and derives each turn from ``(incoming, state)``, never reading
the authored table or the compiled script. The table is the **golden master** —
the validation oracle the runner checks every emitted turn against; this module
reads it zero times.

The Rationaliser is a **bootstrap double**: a genuine rationaliser in mechanism,
destined to be replaced only by another rationaliser (the full ``KAgent``),
never by a synthesizer. Its cogitation is deliberately simplified —
synchronous, deterministic, inline — standing in for the real Kalvin's async
``expand()`` / ``propose_expansions()`` slow path. See the plan's Design
Decisions (D1–D12) and §The Rationaliser Mechanism.

This is the **initial shell** (plan Phase 1.1, in progress). The entry rule,
the two cogitation levels (Identity, Relationships), the grouping convention,
and group-size escalation are stubbed below and filled in subsequent steps.

# each value the list of grounded klines under that signature. There is no
# ordered distinction between identities and relationships: they are all

class Rationaliser:
    """A stateful trainee actor that rationalises (plan §Purpose, D1–D12).

    Satisfies the ``Actor`` protocol (``@specs/dialogue-driven-training.md``
    §Actor) with ``role="K"``. Each :meth:`respond` call:

    1. Applies the **entry rule** to ``incoming`` as bookkeeping (S4 → pop a
       matching entry; S1 → ground immediately and pop a matching entry; S2/S3
       → push and enter cogitation at Level 0).
    2. Runs **cogitation** on the selected work-list entry (LIFO) — Level 0
       (Identity) or Level 1 (Relationships) — and emits exactly one event.
    3. Returns ``None`` when the work-list is empty after the entry rule (the
       runner then signals termination — plan D12; termination is the runner's
       job, not K's).

    Reads neither the table nor the compiled script nor ``dbg`` (plan D1, D2,
    D4). Constructs synthetic signatures via ``signifier.make_signature`` when
    the grouping convention requires it (plan D9, D10).
