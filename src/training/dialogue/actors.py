"""Dialogue actors (spec ``@specs/dialogue-driven-training.md``).

A lesson is an authored dialogue between a Trainer (T) and a Trainee (K). The
actors here are the **dialogue participants**: each holds an
:class:`~training.dialogue.runner.EventSink` (injected at construction) and
publishes its turns to it via :meth:`Actor.accept` (fire-and-forget,
one-or-many per incoming). The runner (:mod:`training.dialogue.runner`) drives
the run over the harness :class:`~training.harness.bus.MessageBus` and
validates emissions against the authored table.

Every ``accept`` yields **at least one** proposal (the ``burst >= 1``
contract, DDT-22): an actor whose cogitation produces nothing substantive
still owes the dialogue a turn, and the :class:`Actor` base emits a **PASS** —
a sentinel no-content proposal
(:func:`~training.dialogue.runner.pass_event`) — when :meth:`next_events`
yields nothing. The runner intercepts PASS before matching; two consecutive
PASSes (each side passing) end the run as a stall.

The two default actors (:class:`TableTrainer`, :class:`TableTrainee`) are
table-reading doubles — structurally identical, differing only by which ``role``
they read. That symmetry is what makes either replaceable by a real trainer or a
real trainee. The default actors are scaffolding, not the design's point.

Two real actors are provided: :class:`SynthesizingTrainer` (a trainer that
derives each turn from the compiled script) and :class:`RationalisingTrainee` (a
stateful trainee that rationalises each turn from its own model). Both publish
via their injected sink, so they are drop-in for the default actors.

# ── The Actor base class ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every dialogue participant shares one invariant: it holds an EventSink and
# publishes its turns to it via ``accept``, fire-and-forget, **one-or-many**
# per incoming. The base class owns that invariant — the sink, the role, and
# the publish loop. A subclass implements only ``next_events``: given an
# incoming event (or ``None`` for the opening seed), produce the turns to
# publish. The base publishes each, and — crucially — emits a PASS when
# ``next_events`` yields nothing, so the ``burst >= 1`` contract always holds.


class Actor:
    """A dialogue participant that publishes turns via an injected sink.

    Holds an :class:`~training.dialogue.runner.EventSink` and a ``role`` (the
    routing key this actor emits on its events). :meth:`accept` is the
    fire-and-forget entry point: it calls :meth:`next_events` and publishes
    each produced event to the sink. ``incoming`` is ``None`` on the opening
    seed (an actor may open), or a prior event otherwise.

    Subclasses override :meth:`next_events` to decide what to publish for a
    given incoming — one, or many events. They must not publish directly to
    the sink; they return events and the base publishes them. When
