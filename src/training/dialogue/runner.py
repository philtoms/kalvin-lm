"""Dialogue runner — a coverage-tracking subscriber over the harness
``MessageBus`` (spec ``@specs/dialogue-driven-training.md``).

The harness :class:`~training.harness.bus.MessageBus` is the **sink and the
relay**; this module's runner (:class:`Runner`) is a **coverage-tracking
wildcard subscriber** plus a thin driver that seeds the opening and runs the bus
until a terminal condition. The actors the runner drives live in
:mod:`training.dialogue.actors`.

An actor takes an :class:`EventSink` at construction and publishes a **burst**
of events to it via ``on_burst``. The runner builds a bus-wired sink per actor
(the sink bridges ``on_burst`` to a single bus ``Message`` — carrying the whole
burst as its payload — addressed to the other role), so any actor is drop-in:
it publishes to its sink, the sink routes onto the bus. Because the bus payload
is ``Any``, a burst rides as one ``Message``; it never serialises across many.

The dialogue is messy and real: **no synchronised alternation** (an actor may
publish one-or-many per incoming), and **anticipation** and **interjection**
are first-class and unflagged. Agents must rationalise and cogitate to make
sense of the stream — the point of Kalvin.

Every ``accept`` yields at least one proposal (the ``burst >= 1`` contract,
§Actor contract): an actor with nothing substantive to say publishes a **PASS**
— a sentinel proposal (``PASS_SIGNATURE`` at S1). The runner intercepts PASS
before matching: it routes to the other role, and **two consecutive PASSes**
(each side passing in turn) is a terminal condition (the actors have nothing
more to say). A run ends mechanically on the close content being seen, the
coverage set being exhausted, or mutual PASS. The **displacement** (uncovered
coverage rows) records how much of the authored exchange the actors traversed.

Spec mapping
------------
- The runner is a bus subscriber holding coverage bookkeeping; the bus is the
  sink/relay. It tracks coverage and immediate divergence.
- Matching (content presence, idempotent coverage, immediate divergence, close).
- Anticipation + interjection (permitted, unflagged).
- The close is de-positional: any agent may emit it at any time; a table has no
  start-middle-end structure, only a coverage set and one close turn.
- ``RunResult`` records the arrival log, immediate divergences, and displacement.
- ``EventSink`` + sink-driven actors.
- No synchronised alternation; route-to-other via the bus-wired sink.
- ``burst >= 1``: an actor always emits at least one proposal; a PASS is the
  no-content proposal. Mutual PASS is a terminal condition.
