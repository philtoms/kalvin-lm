"""Peer dialogue runner — a coverage-tracking subscriber over the harness
``MessageBus`` (spec ``@specs/peer-dialogue.md``).

The harness :class:`~training.harness.bus.MessageBus` is the **sink and the
relay**; the peer runner is a **coverage-tracking wildcard subscriber** plus a
thin driver that seeds the opening and runs the bus until the closing is seen.

This module mirrors the :class:`~kalvin.agent.KAgent` adapter pattern: actors
take an :class:`EventSink` at construction (as KAgent takes an adapter) and
publish events to it (as KAgent publishes via its adapter). The runner builds a
bus-wired sink per actor (the sink bridges ``on_event`` to a bus ``Message``
addressed to the other role), so any adapter-driven actor is drop-in.

The dialogue is messy and real: **no synchronised alternation** (an actor may
publish zero-or-many per incoming), and **anticipation** and **interjection**
are first-class and unflagged. Agents must rationalise and cogitate to make
sense of the stream — the point of Kalvin.

Spec mapping
------------
- PDT-5/PDT-6 — the runner is a bus subscriber holding coverage bookkeeping
  only; the bus is the sink/relay.
- PDT-7..PDT-10 — matching (content presence, idempotent coverage, divergence,
  closing).
- PDT-11/PDT-12 — anticipation + interjection (permitted, unflagged, middle-only).
- PDT-13 — completion (closing-seen; coverage is a diagnostic, not a gate).
- PDT-14/PDT-15 — :class:`PeerDivergence` / :class:`PeerRunResult`.
- PDT-17 — ``EventSink`` + adapter-driven actors (mirrors KAgent).
- PDT-18 — no synchronised alternation; route-to-other via the bus-wired sink.
- PDT-19 — terminate on closing-seen; idle timeout ends a stall as incomplete.
